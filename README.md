### App Walk-though

`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walk-though `gif` in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (☝️ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif). LICEcap is a great tool for recording and you can simply upload the gif to GitHub and provide the path name in place of URL as shown below.
